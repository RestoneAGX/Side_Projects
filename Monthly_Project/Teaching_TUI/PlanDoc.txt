Lesson:
    What is C, its uses, and how to set it up on all platforms?
    Variables
    Pointers
    Arithmatic
    Conditions {==, !=, &&, ||, !, truey & falsey}
    Bitwise Operatons { &, |, ^, ~, >>, << }
    Loops {for, while}
    Arrays {single and multi-diminsional, plus some syntactic sugar}
    Structs
    Unions
    functions {recursion, nested functions, callback, arguments, parameter}

    Dynamic Memory Allocation
    Memory Allocation / Strings
    File Handling
    Preprocessor {#Define, IfDefs, Pragma, }
    Libraries {glibc, external libs}
    Building {Make, CMake}
    I Don't Know Where to put these { type casting, enums, ternary, Bit-fields in structs, goto}

Higher Level:
    Paradigm
    Branchless
    Abstraction

Lower Level:
    Physical hardware {RAM, CPU, DISK, GPU, I/O}
    Registers
    Assembly
